Make an attendance calculator website, which can run on local host
you can take the inputs of user as the start of the semester date and end 
of the semester date, and you can give the options to the user where user
can add his leaves, if tomorrow or more days, he is going to take a leave
then what will be his/her attendace after the leave period and how many
days will it take to reach 75% attendance over all, make this as per C4 
section time table. The user can also add current attendance and start
from today his calculations. The holidays calender is on the CBIT website
there's no attendance or classes on holidays. Make sure to remember that.
